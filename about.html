      <h2>David Park</h2>
      <p>Good morning gamers! My name is David Park and I am a student of Mr.Marchant's 4th Period AP Computer Scienc class.  <a class = "link" target="_blank" href="https://mrmarchant.com/">(click here to see more ;))</a> I am a passionate
      and motivated coder out to explore the deep and mysterious realm of coding. Some of my other hobbies include Video Editing, Photography, Photoshop, CGI, 3D CAD, and more. This is my first website that is near completion and I decided to write
      about the dying trees that the government is doing nothing about. I wanted to do my part in wearing awareness for out dying ecosystem even if it writing a website that only advertises the donation. Everyone's gotta start somewhere.
       In the following years, I look forward to advancing my literacy of this hobby as I explore further into Java, Python, HTML, CSS, and JS.</p><br>
