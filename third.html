      <p>Trees are arguably the most vital organisms on Earth. They pretty much <a id="whoops">branch</a> out into every aspect of the environment.
      They recycle our mass produced Carbon Dioxide into Oxygen so we can breathe while mainting the global carbon gas emissions at the same time.
      Just by existing, they are able to maintain a delicate balance of nutrients in the soil while also protecting it from erosion and flooding.
      Furthermore, while mainting a healthy soil balance, it is home to thousands of organisms that make up the Earth as we know it today.</p>
